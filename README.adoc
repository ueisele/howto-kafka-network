In each scenario the goal is to monitor Kafka traffic with Wireshark or Termshark.

* Single Kafka network with deticated Zookeeper network
* Distinct network for Kafka replication
* Tracing Kafka requests with Envoy proxy
* Enable access to Kafka from another network, which can not directly access the Kafka network
** Two scenarios (Traefik and Envoy)
